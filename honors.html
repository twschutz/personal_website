                        my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. I am also pursuing a minor in Statistics and 
                        am considering the Multidisciplinary Design Program minor as well. Outside of my academics, I am part
                        of different student organizations on campus. I have always had a passion for finance and as such 
                        I am a member of the Technology Sector Stock Pitch Team in Apex Trading Group, one of the University 
                        of Michigan's premier Ross-affiliated trading clubs. I hope to bring my computer science knowledge
                        to ATG in order to help assist my stock pitch team as well as other members of ATG by developing tools
                        that make their lives easier. I am also a member of a programming team named One Team Coding where I 
                        participate in the development cycle as a part of a large group in order to present a final product
                        at the end of each semester. This past semester, we worked to develop a tutoring web app for University of Michigan Students 
                        named TutorMe where students can solicit help from their peers in many of their more popular classes. Pre-COVID I 
                        was also alternated between the positions of Flanker and Outside Center for the University of Michigan Men's Rugby Team
                        where I developed strong teamwork and communication skills and made life-long friendships.

                    <p class="about-text-honors">
                        Apex Trading Group is one of the University of Michigan's Premier Trading Groups.
                        As a member of ATG and the Technology Sector Pitch Team, I research macroeconomic trends, stock market news, company financials, and new technological developments to assess
                        investment opportunities in the technology sector. I them help analyze and constructively critique my teammates recommendations in order to choose a final company to pitch to
                        the entire Apex Trading Group team. Our past pitches have exceeded the benchmark growth rates set by ATG leaders and have seen an average return of 18% in the past year alone.
                        As a member of ATG who is majoring in a STEM field, I also communicate with various different team members from across many majors to discuss the possibility of developing tools
                        which makes their analysis of companies much easier and less repetetive. I hope to be able to eventually apply my knowledge of Computer Science and Finance to develop algorithmic trading strategies which utilize various technical indicators and company statistics in order to support stock
                        pitches and identify areas for new investment opportunities.

                    <p class="about-text-honors">
                        1 Team Coding is a student organization at the University of Michigan founded in Fall 2019. Its founding principle is to expand student leadership and computer programming knowledge and interest through team collaboration on innovative software projects.
                        Each semester, our team discusses various possible opportunities for projects which we could undertake which will have an impact on those around us while also developing our own programming skills and learning new languages.
                        This past semester, I collaborated with a team of over 30 engineers to develop a web app called TutorMe using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React Native, NodeJS). TutorMe seeks to help connect University of Michigan students with peer tutors who can assist them with their coursework. We believe that this will provided a platform for which students can form study groups and get
                        academic assistance for not only large, popular classes but also smaller classes for which finding study resources or tutors is often difficult. Throughout the course of this project, I have learned a lot about programming with a MERN stack and have had to persevere through the process of learning new languages while also meeting deadlines and developing new features for the app.
                        I have also been forced to think more creatively not only to solve programming challenges as I encounter them but also to design the app in a user-friendly, intuitive, and appealing way.

                    <p class="about-text-honors">
                        University of Michigan Rugby Football Club (UMRFC) is the menâ€™s rugby team at the University of Michigan. Michigan Rugby is a championship-caliber organization, and is dedicated towards pursuing both rugby excellence and a world-class rugby experience for all. We currently play in the Big Ten conference at the D1A level, the highest division of collegiate rugby in the United States.
                        As a flanker and center on the Men's Rugby Team I developed strong teamwork and communication skills, both of which are integral to any good rugby team. I also developed my grit and risk management abilities as I persevered through mental and physical adversities and learned how to make play decisions on the fly that could benefit my team.

                       The Big Shoulders Fund is a Chicago-based non-profit organization that helps support inner-city schools to provide all students with access to a quality education. At the Big Shoulders Fund I was a member of the Teen Board Executive Committee and co-chair of the Outreach committee. On the Executive Committee, I assisted in organizing over 90 volunteers to participate in Give Back Days, fundraisers, and other club activities. 
                       As a member of the Outreach Committee, I led a team of 15 teens to devise new ways to recruit teenagers from across Chicago to help those that are less fortunate than them. As a volunteer for over 400 hours, I drastically improved my communication and leadership skills and demonstrated my global and cultural awareness.
