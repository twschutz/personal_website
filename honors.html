                        my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in Engineering with a minor in Statistics. I hope that 
                        this combination of my studies will allow me to learn more about and thrive in the field of
                        Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have been afforded some amazing experiences during 
                        my time at Michigan which include being a part of a research lab on campus, interning at a local law 
                        firm, as well as being a member of some amazing clubs! Read more below to learn more about my experiences
                        and journey as an Engineering Honors student here at Michigan!

                        Apex Trading Group is one of the University of Michigan's Premier Trading Groups.
                        As a member of ATG and the Technology Sector Pitch Team, I research macroeconomic trends, stock market news, company financials, and new technological developments to assess
                        investment opportunities in the technology sector. I help analyze and constructively critique my teammates recommendations in order to choose a final company to pitch to
                        the entire Apex Trading Group team. Our past pitches have exceeded the benchmark growth rates set by ATG leaders and have seen an average return of 18% in the past year alone.
                        I hope to be able to eventually apply my knowledge of Computer Science and Finance to develop algorithmic trading strategies which utilize various technical indicators and company statistics in order to support stock
                        pitches and identify areas for new investment opportunities.

                        MSAIL, the Michigan Student Artificial Intelligence Lab is, as the name suggests, a group of students who have a passion
                        for exploring the field of Machine Learning and share their knowledge through weekly paper reviews, education meetings, 
                        and hands-on team projects that allow me to not only learn about recent developments in AI/ML but also to use this knowledge
                        in a team-environment.

                    <p class="about-text-honors">
                        University of Michigan Rugby Football Club (UMRFC) is the menâ€™s rugby team at the University of Michigan. Michigan Rugby is a championship-caliber organization, and is dedicated towards pursuing both rugby excellence and a world-class rugby experience for all. We currently play in the Big Ten conference at the D1A level, the highest division of collegiate rugby in the United States.
                        As a flanker and center on the Men's Rugby Team I developed strong teamwork and communication skills, both of which are integral to any good rugby team. I also developed my grit and risk management abilities as I persevered through mental and physical adversities and learned how to make play decisions on the fly that could benefit my team.

                    <p class="about-text-honors">
                       The Big Shoulders Fund is a Chicago-based non-profit organization that helps support inner-city schools to provide all students with access to a quality education. At the Big Shoulders Fund I was a member of the Teen Board Executive Committee and co-chair of the Outreach committee. On the Executive Committee, I assisted in organizing over 90 volunteers to participate in Give Back Days, fundraisers, and other club activities. 
                       As a member of the Outreach Committee, I led a team of 15 teens to devise new ways to recruit teenagers from across Chicago to help those that are less fortunate than them. As a volunteer for over 400 hours, I drastically improved my communication and leadership skills and demonstrated my global and cultural awareness.
